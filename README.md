# Groups
For SPARK, we have broken up into two different groups. In each group, we have chosen a dataset from **Kaggle** to answer some question about the data. 

## Group 1
Group 1 is exploring a dataset of Star Wars characters. Please check out their project [here](/group_01)

## Group NarWolves
Group NarWolves is exploring a dataset Marvel vs DC films and their IMDB rating. Please check out their project [here](/group_02)
